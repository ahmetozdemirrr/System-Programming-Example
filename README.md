# System-Programming-Example

The code I wrote in this repository contains easy and hard exercises I did before my System Programming course.

1. [simple-file-system](/simple-file-system) - A simple file system
2. [mini-shell](/mini-shell) - A mini shell with (ls, cd, pwd, echo and exit commands)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification. Happy coding! ðŸš€
