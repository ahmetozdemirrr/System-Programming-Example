    This example includes a simple shell application. mini-shell allows the user to execute basic commands and interact with operating system resources.

## Usage

1. **Compiling and Running:**

    ```bash
    gcc shell.c -o mini-shell
    ./mini-shell
    ```
    or 

    ```bash
    make
    ```

2. **Commands:**

    - **ls**: Lists files and directories in the current directory.
    
    - **cd \<directory\>**: Switches to the specified directory.
    
    - **pwd**: Shows the current working directory.
    
    - **echo \<text\>**: Prints the given text on the screen.

## Points to be Considered

- mini-shell, supports basic shell commands.
  
- Executed commands are executed in a new process (`fork()` and `exec()`).

- In case of errors, the appropriate error messages are displayed.

## Example Usage

    After compiling and running mini-shell, you can use the supported commands and observe the results.

```bash
Shell> ls
file1.txt  file2.txt  directory1  directory2

Shell> cd directory1

Shell> pwd
/path/to/mini-shell/directory1

Shell> echo Hello, mini-shell!
Hello, mini-shell!

Shell> exit
```
Notes:

* The ls and pwd commands are executed directly with exec() due to system dependencies.

* cd and echo commands are processed in mini-shell.
